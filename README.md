# C-IoTDemos
IoT demos written for the Arduino IDE in C++
## Purpose
The demo programs in this repository have been written for a workshop on IoT at the African Internet Summit (AIS) 2019 in Kampala Uganda. The programs have essentially the same functionality as the ones in the MicroPython_IoTDemos repository but here they are written in C++ for the Arduino IDE with the ESP8266 or the ESP32 processor.
